BLOCK MAZE COMPLETION:

After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? 
Cut and paste and assign it to the variable level_10_code.
How many blocks did you have left? 
Assign it to the variable remaining_blocks.

CODE:

level_10_code = '''while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
    turnRight();
  }
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
}
'''
remaining_blocks = level_10_code
print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)
print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)

OUTPUT:

JavaScript code for Level 10
while (notDone()) {
  if (isPathForward()) {
    moveForward();
  } else {
    turnRight();
    turnRight();
  }
  if (isPathLeft()) {
    turnLeft();
  }
}
('Number of blocks remaining', 
'while (notDone()) {\n  
if (isPathForward()) {\n    
moveForward();\n  } 
else {\n    
turnRight();\n    
turnRight();\n  }\n  
if (isPathLeft()) {\n

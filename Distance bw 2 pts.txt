#Distance between two points

Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
To find the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2),
all that you need to do is use the coordinates of these ordered pairs. 
Begin with the most simplest formula and then incrementally arrive at the correct formula as you solve the test cases.

import math

x1 = int (input())  


y1 = int (input())  

x2 = int (input())
y2 = int (input())


dist = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

print (dist)

#Even elements
Given a list of numbers, print all its even elements. 
Use a for-loop that iterates over the list itself and not over its indices. 
That is, don't use range()

#input
1 2 2 3 3 3 4

#code
a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

for elem in a:
  
if elem % 2 == 0:
    
print(elem)


#output
2 2 4

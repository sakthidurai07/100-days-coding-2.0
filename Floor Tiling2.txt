#Floor Tiling2

Imagine you want to tile a rectangle floor. You approach a tile manufacturer to produce tiles for you.The tile manufacturer can produce only square tiles
He is willing to custom make them for you, but you can pick only one size
The bigger they are, the less expensive they will be
For example, if you order 5x5 tiles, they will be lot less expensive than 1x1 tiles
You want to ensure every part of the floor is covered  (i.e. there are no holes or gaps)
You want to select tiles of dimension such that there is no need for breaking them
Write a function tile_solve to calculate the optimum tile dimension, which 
accept a 3rd parameter, which when not provided, defaults to value of 1. 

#code

def tile_solve(length, breadth, min_dim=0):
  
 if breadth==0:
    
  return length
  
 elif length%breadth<min_dim:
      
  return breadth
  
 else:
      
  return tile_solve(breadth,length%breadth,min_dim)


#output

tile_solve(10, 5)     -> 5 
tile_solve(6, 4)      -> 2 
tile_solve(1071, 462) -> 21

# print hours and minutes

Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight.
how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) 
and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).
For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 
Therefore, the time now is 1:05am.
So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 
65 full minutes passed since midnight.

#input
3900

#code
N = int(input()) 

nbminutesdepuisminuit = N//60

H = nbminutesdepuisminuit//60


print(str(H) + str(nbminutesdepuisminuit))

#output
1 65

#JugsMugsPugsPlus and Reverse
Write a program that receives a number on the input.
It also should receive another value 'rev'  (either 0 or 1) on the input. 
If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"
Otherwise, it prints the number.
If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing. 
"PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
"PugsMugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
"MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
"PugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 7

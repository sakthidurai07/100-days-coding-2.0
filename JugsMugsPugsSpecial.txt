#JugsMugsPugsSpecial
Write a program that receives a number on the input,
prints values from 1 to that number subjected to the conditions below. 
It also should receive another value 'rev' (either 0 or 1) on the input. 
For every number in the given range,   
If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs".   
If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".  
If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".        
also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"  
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".        
also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"
Otherwise, it prints the number.
If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing.    
"PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7   
"PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7   
"MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5    
"PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7

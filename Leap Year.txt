# Leap Year
Given the year number.You need to check if this year is a leap year. 
If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.
The rules in Gregorian calendar are as follows:
a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 
and is not exactly divisible by 100
a year is always a leap year 
if its number is exactly divisible by 400

#input

#code
a = int(input())

print(a)

if a%4 == 0 and a%100 != 0 :
  
print ("LEAP")

elif a%400 == 0 :
  
print ("LEAP")

else  :
  
print ("COMMON")

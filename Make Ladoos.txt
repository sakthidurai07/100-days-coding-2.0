#Make Ladoos

For this year Diwali, we need to assemble a parcel of goal kilos of ladoos. There are small ladoos (2 kilos each) and big ladoos (5 kilos each). 
Write a function that returns the number of small ladoos to use, assuming we always use big ladoos before small ladoos. Return -1 if it can't be done.
make_ladoos(small, big, goal) 
small -> number of small ladoos available
big -> number of big ladoos available
goal -> the desired weight of the final package
Bonus points for coming with a solution that has no for-loops or while-loops.

#code

def make_ladoos(small,big,goal):
  
  
count=0
  
  
if goal!=0:
    
if big!=0 and 5<goal:
      
if big*5<=goal:
        
return count+make_ladoos(small,0,goal-big*5)
      
else:	
        
a=goal//5
        
return count+make_ladoos(small,big-a,goal-a*5)
    
else:
      
if goal%2==1:
        
return -1
      
elif small!=0 and 2 <= goal:
        
count=1
        
return count + make_ladoos(small-1,big,goal-2)
  
  
else:
    
    
return count

print(make_ladoos(4,1,14))


#output

make_ladoos (4, 1, 13)    ->  4
make_ladoos (4, 1, 14)    -> -1
make_ladoos (2, 1, 7)     ->  1

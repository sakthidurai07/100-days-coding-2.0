#Convert Nested Lists to Matrix

Write a function that accepts a nested list as an argument. 
It must return the incoming nested list into a well formed matrix. 

The nested list may have lists that contain varied number of elements.
Balance out the rows in the matrix so that all rows are equal to the longest 
row in the nested list. Use fillvalue 0 to populate the rows accordingly. 

#Example 

convert_to_matrix([[1, 2]])    -> [[1, 2]]
convert_to_matrix([[1], [2, 3]]) -> [[1, 0], [2, 3]]
convert_to_matrix([[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) -> 
  [[1, 0, 0], 
   [2, 3, 0],
   [4, 5, 6]]

#code

def convert_to_matrix(alist):
  
len_of_max_list = max([len(i) for i in alist] or [0])
  
for row in alist:
      
row.extend([0] * (len_of_max_list - len(row)))
  
print(alist)
  
return alist

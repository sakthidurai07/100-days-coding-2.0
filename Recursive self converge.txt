#Recursive self_converge

Goal: Given a number (with a minimum of 3 digits), the function self_converge should return the number of iterations it takes to arrive at a derived number that converges on to itself.

As a learning exercise, come up with a solution that uses recursion. 

The following steps would be applicable to a number that originally had exactly 4 digits.
Initialize a counter to count the number of iterations
Take any four-digit number n, using at least two different digits.
Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary. Add as many zeroes so that the width of the original number is maintained.
Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Let us call this nseq.
Check whether nseq from Step 4 equals the previous value of n. If not, increment the iteration counter and go back to step 2 and perform it on the nseq.

If the number of digits to start with was more than 4, convergence occurs on to a cycle of numbers. Therefore in Step 5, detect this cycle by comparing to not only the previous value, but to all previous values of n.
If there is a match, then return the count of iterations
If the sequence_number collapses to zero, then return -1

#Converge values

While 3-digit numbers converge to the same unique number k which is also 3 digits long, all 4-digit numbers also converge to the same unique value k1 which is 4 digits long. 
However, 5 digit numbers converge to any one of the following values: 53955, 59994, 61974, 62964, 63954, 71973, 74943, 75933, 82962, 83952.
